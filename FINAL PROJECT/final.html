<div class="large-8 medium-8 small-12 cell">
       <p> 20-year-old Tariq Jernigan’s life has always revolved around football.

Jernigan followed in his brother’s footsteps from a young age. At just five years old, Jernigan started playing the sport he fell in love with.
<br><br>
“I just loved to play,” Jernigan said. “I would knock on my neighbors' door at 9:00 a.m. to get them to come outside and play.”
<br><br>
Like many athletes, by high school, Jernigan realized his football career wouldn’t remain on the field after graduation.
<br><br>
“I was 5’7 my sophomore year, so I knew this would be the end of the road for me,” Jernigan said.
<br><br>
Although his physical limitations ended his career as a player, Jernigan decided to open a new chapter of his life that still involved football.
<br><br>
Three years into studying at the University of Maryland, Jernigan has solidified himself as one of the most underappreciated members of the football program.
<br><br>
Jernigan is a board holder – meaning when offensive coordinator Josh Gattis calls a play — it’s up to Jernigan to inform the offense.
<br><br>
After the call, Jernigan has to sort through numerous boards in a few seconds to find the correct one, which he then reveals to the entire offense.

  “It can be stressful in the moment,” Jernigan said. “When I first started doing it, I got yelled at by the coaches a lot because I messed up.”
<br><br>
Jernigan is in his second year at the position; he said getting yelled at by the coaching staff made him feel like a player.
<br><br>
Jernigan’s freshman-year occupation wasn’t involved with on-field responsibilities, as he handled his role as equipment manager. Jernigan said being an equipment manager was stressful and time-consuming. 
<br><br>
“It wasn’t my first choice when I started, but I saw the job posted on Maryland football’s Instagram, and I knew it was a good opportunity for me to get started,” Jernigan said.
<br><br>
Jernigan said he learned a lot about football operations in that job, but deep down, he knew he wanted involvement on the field.
<br><br>
“Doing boards makes you engaged with every drive,” Jernigan said. “You have to know what you’re doing and be focused because one mistake can tear a whole drive apart.”
<br><br>
There were times when the drive did fall apart – and from those mistakes — Jernigan learned and earned trust from head coach Mike Locksley.

<p>
Jernigan fondly remembers a time against Charlotte when one of the offensive players lined up incorrectly. Locksley chewed the player out, but the player deflected the blame toward the board holders.
<br><br>
Because Locksley trusted  Jernigan and the others, Locksley replied, “Don’t make that excuse. We know the boards did their job.”
<br><br>
“We don’t get a lot of recognition typically, so that was a good feeling,” Jernigan said.
<br><br>
It isn’t just games where Jernigan has to fulfill his duties. He also attends practices, just as a player does daily.

  At practice, Jernigan and the other board holders practice game-like scenarios with the offense. This creates major time commitments for Jernigan, who also focuses on schoolwork.
<br><br>
Jernigan studies Journalism, where he focuses on sports reporting. 

<br><br>
Jernigan envisions becoming a football coach after college. However, he’s also interested in potentially pursuing a football media career.
<br><br>
“I’ve always been interested in reporting on football,” Jernigan said. “In a way, enough players from Maryland have made the NFL, so I feel like what I’m doing has helped me build connections for down the road.”
<br><br>
Relationships are vital for Jernigan, and his experience as a board holder propelled him to numerous connections.
<br><br>
“I’ve tried to introduce myself to as many people as possible,” Jernigan said. “I want to be on the field and still in the game for as long as I can be.”
<br><br>
When something happens for Maryland football, good or bad, the board holders often have a lot of influence. Jernigan said there have been numerous occasions where they made a mistake, which resulted in offensive failure.
<br><br>
At the same time, when Jernigan’s board reveals a play that becomes a touchdown, those are the moments that he’ll never forget.

“It’s just so cool to be a part of a play like that in some form,” Jernigan said.
<br><br>
Jernigan’s three years with Maryland football became a vital chapter of his chapter toward a full-time football career. In that time, the team has made three-straight bowl games, as they attempt to keep climbing the Big Ten standings.
